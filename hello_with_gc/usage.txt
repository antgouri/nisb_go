8g for amd64, 6g for i(386), 5g for arm

tools like these 

hello.go

6g hello.go
6l hello.6
./6.out


8g hello.go
8l hello.8
./8.out


They were the fundamental compilers used earlier

With Go 1.5, these were replaced with "go tool compile" 


so...

go tool compile hello.go

go tool link hello.o

./a.out
